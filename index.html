        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I began my career as a Mechanical Engineering apprentice and since then I worked my way up to a Subsea Engineer for a leading Oil &amp; Gas company, during this time I was studying and received a Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering and some post-grad stuff also. Since the Oil crash I decided there is more to life! So, I set out to do some travelling!</p>
        <p>Currently I am a Foreign Language Teacher (TEFL) in Foshan, China. I started my journey along with my fiance in April 2017 and we will be here for 12-18 month's. When we finish we will do some longer term travelling and be back in the UK before the end of 2018.</p>
        <p>One of my 'life' lessons out here in China so far, is that it is important to enjoy your job. So this is why I have commited to the treehouse Techdegree and I hope to find opportunities when I arrive home.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I have always held a strong interest in technology, coding being an imperative part of the technology world! After my travelling is complete I hope to return to the UK and land myself a position within the Web Development industry.</p>
        <p>My <strong>ULTIMATE</strong> goal is to successfully switch careers after some time enjoying life.</p>
